# Coin Dilemma Practice

Super simple / silly implementation of the puzzle described here:

- [The almost impossible chessboard puzzle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as7Gkm7Y7h4)

## A quick summary of the puzzle is:

> A jailer devises a game to play with two prisoners. With one prisoner watching in the room, he will place a key on a random square of a standard 8x8 chessboard. Next he will place on each square a coin, which will completely hide the key, and each coin can be placed heads up of tails up at his discretion. The first prisoner is then allowed to choose any coin on the board and flip it, such that if it was heads it will now be tails, and vice-versa. Afterwards, the first prisoner leaves and the second prisoner enters the room. The second prisoner is allowed to lift any coin off the table, and if the key is found they both go free, otherwise they are... executed!
>
> The two prisoners are explained the rules beforehand and are allowed to devise a strategy. During the actual test, they cannot communicate to each other in any way. There are no secret messages, misplacing, or rotating of coins allowed. The only information shared between the two prisoners is the locations and orientation of the coins on the board.
